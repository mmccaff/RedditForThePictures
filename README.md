RedditForThePictures
====================

Using Node.js, Node.io, Express, Mongoose, EJS, and jQuery+Masonry to display images from the Reddit front page or subreddits as an irregular grid of pictures. 
Using Node.io to scrape the data (yes, I know Reddit has an API) and MongoDB to store the link data.

This was written in a few hours to play with some new node modules.
